Features:
 - Constant, Gouraud, Phong shading models;
 - Phong specular illumination model;
 - Support point light sources;
 - Fix round-up mistakes of previous version;
 - Rewrite some formats and classes (again...).

p.s.
 - dont ever copy and paste the similar codes (even worse: they have similar viriable' names) you just wrote !!! it took me more than 3 hours to locate this bug (because they look very similar to the correct code)!!!
